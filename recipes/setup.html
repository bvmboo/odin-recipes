    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <p>In order to access Rocket League, it's important to have the game present
        either on Steam or on Epic Games since we will be using it on PC. The instructions
        go as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download one of the launchers</li>
        <p>As of now, the game is no longer on Steam but can be downloaded
            for free on Epic Games. But you'll need to download the launcher 
            first: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download">Download Epic Games here</a>
        </p>
        <li>Create an account or Sign In</li>
        <p>You can use the link given above to create your account while downloading the 
            launcher.
        </p>
        <li>Install the game</li>
        <p>On the Launcher, you can easily download the game by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Store page, search for Rocket League</li>
            <li>Select "Add to Library"</li>
            <li>In your Library, begin download by clicking on the game</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Boot the title</li>
        <p>You're now ready to play!</p>
    </ol>
