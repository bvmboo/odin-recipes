    <h1>Welcome to Rocket League</h1>
    <p>Rocket League is a hybrid between football and cars. It has 
        been around since ~2014 and has seen its popularity increase 
        as the game became Free to Play after being bought by Epic Games. 
        It involves two teams varying from 1 to 4, with a ball and two goals within an arena. 
        Each team tries to best the other in a 5 minutes match.
